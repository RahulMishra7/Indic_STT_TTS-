In a landmark event, Civil Aviation Minister Shri Ram Mohan Naidu chaired the signing ceremony of the H130 helicopter fuselage manufacturing contract between Airbus and Mahindra Aerostructures Pvt. Ltd. The ceremony, held at the Ministry of Civil Aviation, was attended by Secretary Civil Aviation Shri Vumlunmang Vualnam, Airbus India & South Asia President Mr. Remi Maillard, Mahindra Group CEO Dr. Anish Shah, and senior industry leaders.

This collaboration marks a significant milestone in India’s aviation sector, reinforcing global confidence in the country’s industrial capabilities. It strengthens the 'Make in India' and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiatives led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. The contract signifies Airbus’s trust in India’s aerospace ecosystem and Mahindra Aerostructures’ ability to deliver high-quality components.

Minister Naidu highlighted that since its inception in 2011, Mahindra Aerostructures has delivered world-class parts to global players like Airbus. He emphasized that today, every Airbus commercial aircraft and helicopter carries critical components designed, manufactured, or maintained in India—setting new benchmarks for aerospace manufacturing.

He also outlined India’s rapid aviation growth:

India is on track to become one of the world’s largest civil aviation markets, with over 2,200 new aircraft expected in the next 20 years.

By 2030, India is projected to handle 630 million passengers annually, growing at a CAGR of 6–8%.

The domestic aerospace manufacturing market is expected to reach $10 billion in 10–15 years, covering structural components, avionics, and more.

Naidu praised Indian MSMEs and startups for supplying over $2 billion worth of aircraft components annually to global OEMs like Airbus and Boeing.

The event builds on the momentum from a February 2025 meeting, chaired by the minister, aimed at accelerating domestic aircraft component manufacturing. This meeting brought together government officials, industry leaders, and experts to chart a strategic roadmap for boosting local production and global competitiveness.

Secretary Shri Vumlunmang Vualnam noted that the H130 fuselage contract would bring advanced technology, employment, and help expand India's Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) capabilities while developing a strong manufacturing base.

He also highlighted India's two Final Assembly Lines: one for the C295 military aircraft—recently inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi and Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez—and the upcoming H125 helicopter line. These projects symbolize India’s rising status in the global aerospace landscape and reflect its strong strategic partnerships with companies like Airbus.
