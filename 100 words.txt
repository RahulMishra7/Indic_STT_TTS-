The Union Cabinet has approved the construction of a 4-lane, 46.7 km Paramakudi–Ramanathapuram highway in Tamil Nadu under the Hybrid Annuity Mode at a cost of ₹1,853 crore. This upgrade of NH-87 will ease congestion, enhance safety, and support growing towns. The corridor will link with major highways, rail stations, Madurai Airport, and ports at Pamban and Rameshwaram, boosting connectivity and regional trade. It will also strengthen links to religious and economic hubs like Rameshwaram and Dhanushkodi, promote tourism, and generate about 18.85 lakh person-days of employment, contributing to regional development and prosperity.
